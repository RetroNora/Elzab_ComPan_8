ComPAN 8 is an 8-bit Polish microcomputer produced in the 1980s at the MERA-ELZAB factory in Zabrze, Poland. 
ComPAN 8 was designed at the Institute of Industry Automation Systems PAN in Gliwice.
My unit is from 1988 and has a S/N of 396 and it labelled as 'Microcomputer 8/16-bit'. 
It is most likely due to a fact that it has a 8088 card (probably a compatibility card for DOS software).
Comes with two RAM boards of 896K of 'common RAM'.
As far as I know there is no official documentation left for this machine.
